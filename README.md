<p>This is my personal web portfolio website, as a side project and a showcase.</p>
<p>I am currently about to embark in my second year as a student with NAIT in the software development stream.</p>
<p>While I enjoy backend more than frontend, I consider myself to have some skill in both. Please view my website to see
more information about who I am, and see if I would be a good fit for your company.</p>
